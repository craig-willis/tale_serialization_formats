This is an example of the `Subsistence Harvest of Salmon from Glennallen Subdistrict, Alaska` Tale represented as JSON-LD using schema.org's vocabulary.

The takeaway points are that 
1. The Tale and data files are `CreativeWorks`
2. `EntryPoint` is probably not the right vocabulary word
3. Data files are aggregated with `hasPart`
